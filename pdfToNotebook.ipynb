      "    63,    142, A new species of smiliogastrin cyprinid is described from tributaries of the middle Congo _River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Restriction of the genus name, Barbus, to certain _large-bodied, (polyploid) barbins, and current uncertainty regarding phylogenetic relationships _among the numerous small-bodied African (diploid) barbs, renders generic assignment for the _new species problematical. Pending the results of ongoing systematic analyses, and to reduce _short-term nomenclatural instability, the new species is described here as a species of “Barbus.”3 _“Barbus” validus, new species, is readily distinguished from all other small-bodied African _barbs by the combined possession of scales in midlateral series that are not enlarged relative to _those along the impinging rows above and below; well-developed barbels, with the maxillary _pair  extending  beyond  the  level  of  mideye,  and  the  mandibular  pair  reaching  the  level  of _midopercle; the presence of numerous conical tubercles over the snout, cheek, and dorsum of _head; a small circular occipital fontanel located medially at the parietal suture; well-developed _gill  rakers,  with  8  or  9  on  the  hypo-  and  ceratobranchial  elements  of  the  first  arch;  a  last _\n",

      "    45,    282, In a recent review of the fishes of the N’sele River, a large affluent tributary entering the _Congo River at Pool Malebo, Monsembula Iyaba et al. (2013) reported on the presence there _of five smiliogastrin cyprinids identified as Barbus humeralis, Barbus matthesi (= Clypeobarbus _matthesi after Stiassny and Sakharova, in press), Barbus miolepis, Barbus vanderysti, and Cly-_peobarbus pleuropholis. The identification of Barbus humeralis was based initially on examina-_tion  of  two  small  individuals  collected  in  a  right  bank  tributary  of  the  N’sele  River,  and _subsequent collections in the neighboring Mayi Ndombe (Black) River, have rendered numer-_ous additional samples of this taxon available for study. Comparison of these specimens with _type and comparative materials of Barbus humeralis, indicate that our initial identification was _made in error. Specimens from the N’Sele and Mayi Ndombe rivers originally identified as B. _humeralis (e.g., Monsembula Iyaba et al., 2013: fig. 7E), although superficially similar to that _taxon, do not conform to Boulenger’s (1902) original description and instead represent an _undescribed species for which a formal taxonomic description is provided herein. Comparative _DNA  sequence  data  in  the  form  of  COI  barcodes  (partial  fragments  of  the  mitochondrial _cytochrome c oxidase I gene) (see table 1, fig. 1) confirm the distinctiveness of the new species, _which differs in sequence from B. humeralis (from the Lulua River, Kasai basin) by more than _8%, a value considerably higher than the standard, albeit somewhat arbitrary, metric of a maxi-_mum of 3% COI sequence divergence for conspecifics (Song et al., 2008)._\n",
      "    45,     58, Since the restriction of the cyprinine genus Barbus sensu stricto to certain of the large bodied, _(polyploid) barbin species of Europe, the African Magreb, and southwestern Asia (Berrebi et al., _1996), an appropriate generic designation for the approximately 300 small bodied (diploid) Afri-_can barbs has remained highly problematical. Recently, however, Yang et al. (2015) have proposed _the resurrection of the oldest available genus name, Enteromius, for these African “small barbs,” _and some authors have adopted that proposal (e.g., Decru et al., 2015). While Yang et al.’s (2015) _study represents progress toward resolution of tribal-level relationships among the more the 1300 _species of the subfamily Cyprininae, their sampling of African members of the newly erected tribe _Smiliogastrini (viz., all African small barbs and their allies, and most members of the Asian genus _Puntius and allies) was limited. And, as noted by Schmidt and Bart (2015), the current lack of _resolution of relationships within the tribe renders the adoption of the name Enteromius for the _numerous small-bodied African barbs problematical. If classification and nomenclature are to _reflect phylogenetic relationships and monophyly is to prevail then, based on the trees presented _by Yang et al. (2015), certain putatively monophyletic genera such as Barboides and Clypeobarbus _will either need to be sunk into Enteromius, or various Enteromius species will need to be reas-_signed to  Barboides and  Clypeobarbus. In the absence of a well-supported tree that includes _\n",

Therefore, in the short term we consider the admittedly far from satis-_factory, but pragmatically transparent option to continue to refer to these species as “Barbus” as _the more conservative nomenclatural choice. For these reasons we have opted to designate the _species described herein as a new “Barbus” species, in the anticipation that ongoing phylogenetic _studies incorporating considerably more of the African small-bodied “Barbus” species (e.g., Hayes _and Armbruster, in litt., July 2015) will provide a solid phylogenetic framework upon which to _base intratribal classification, generic assignments, and a stable nomenclature for the numerous _African smiliogastrin species. _\n",

Most gut contents contained disarticulated _insect remains, including many tricopteran larvae and fragmented sand cases, numerous _chironomid larval head cases and bodies, and various unidentifiable insect remains. In addi-_tion, woody debris, seeds, and macerated grasses, and few terrestrial arthropod remains of _spiders and ants are also present, suggesting the species is opportunistically harvesting both _aquatic and exogenous resources._\n",

      "    44,    224, Resolution of phylogenetic relationships among the more than 300 species of African smil-_iogastrins  remains  an  outstanding  problem  in  cyprinid  systematics  (Berrebi  et  al.,  1996; _Schmidt and Bart, 2015). While no attempt is made here to place the newly discovered “Bar-_bus” validus phylogenetically, we do note some apparent similarities between this species and _certain members of the smiliogastrin genus, Clypeobarbus, as recently rediagnosed by Stiassny _and Sakharova (in press). Similarly, “Barbus” humeralis, the species with which “B.” validus was _initially confused, also shares features in common with Clypeobarbus species. For example, “B.” _humilis shares with Clypeobarbus the derived presence of an elongate, occipital fontanel bor-_dered anteriorly and laterally by the frontals and parietals, and posteriorly by the supraoccipital _(fig. 4B). An occipital fontanel is also usually present in “B.” validus. However, that fontanel is _small and circular, contained entirely within the parietals and located at the parietal suture in _the midline (compare fig. 4A and B, C). “Barbus” humilis additionally shares with Clypeobarbus _the derived presence of a distinctive pigmentation streak located posterodorsal to the cleithrum _(cleithral streak, fig. 1). While a faint cleithral streak is often present in large specimens of “B.” _validus, it is less strongly marked, narrower, and often obscured by the posterior margin of the _opercle. “Barbus” validus has a faint caudal bar in the region of caudal flexion, a feature con-_sidered diagnostic of Clypeobarbus by Stiassny and Sakharova (in press). Finally, although not _strictly  diagnostic  for  Clypeobarbus,  neither  species  share  the  pattern  of  free  neuromasts _arranged in sensory pit lines on the head as seen in Clypeobarbus and certain (Enteromius) _“Barbus” species, but both exhibit numerous conical tubercles over the snout and cheek, and _additionally share with the species of Clypeobarbus the presence of a last unbranched dorsal-fin _ray that is weakly ossified, flexible, and without serrations along its posterior edge. However, _both “B.” humilis and “B.” validus lack the characteristic enlargement of midline scales diag-_nostic for Clypeobarbus, and in both species the scales in the midlateral series are not enlarged _relative to those along impinging rows above and below. As indicated previously, phylogenetic _relationships among the numerous small-bodied “Barbus” are far from resolved, and pending _the results of ongoing analyses we refrain here from proposing any generic reassignment for _these two species. _\n",
